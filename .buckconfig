# for the sake of future compatibility and migrations, we don't want any BUILD
# files in the project to use raw, un-imported symbols from the prelude like
# 'cxx_library()'; we instead want to make sure every rule is explicitly
# wrapped, load()ed and called, i.e. they should use 'depot.cxx_library()' instead.
# do this by loading noprelude.bzl into every BUILD file, which will stub out
# these bad symbols with an error message.
