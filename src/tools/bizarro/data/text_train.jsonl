{"text": "The Theory of Relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. It consists of two parts: Special Relativity (1905) and General Relativity (1915). Special Relativity showed that space and time are interconnected and that the speed of light is constant for all observers."}
{"text": "Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. Unlike classical physics, quantum mechanics reveals that particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, a phenomenon known as superposition."}
{"text": "The human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each connected to thousands of others through synapses. This vast network processes information, stores memories, and generates consciousness through complex electrochemical processes that scientists are still working to fully understand."}
{"text": "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate variations occur naturally, scientific evidence shows that human activities since the Industrial Revolution have significantly accelerated these changes, primarily through greenhouse gas emissions."}
{"text": "Artificial neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information through weighted connections. Deep learning uses multiple layers of these networks to recognize patterns and make predictions in complex data."}
