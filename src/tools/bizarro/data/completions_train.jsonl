{"prompt": "What is the speed of light?", "completion": "The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second (about 186,282 miles per second). This is a fundamental constant in physics, often denoted as 'c'."}
{"prompt": "How do you calculate the area of a circle?", "completion": "The area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = πr², where 'A' is the area, 'π' (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and 'r' is the radius of the circle."}
{"prompt": "What is the largest planet in our solar system?", "completion": "Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. It's a gas giant with a mass greater than all other planets combined and has a diameter of about 142,984 kilometers."}
{"prompt": "How do you convert Celsius to Fahrenheit?", "completion": "To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, use the formula: F = (C × 9/5) + 32, where F is Fahrenheit and C is Celsius. For example, 20°C = (20 × 9/5) + 32 = 68°F."}
{"prompt": "What is photosynthesis?", "completion": "Photosynthesis is the process where plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose and oxygen. The chemical equation is: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂."}
