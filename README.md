# Austin's monorepo

A unifying monorepository of my various buck2-oriented projects. Some code may
be exported from here. I got the idea from [Xe Iaso's `x` repository][x]. The
internal name to the monorepo is `depot`, which is a friendly homage to [tvl].

Do not touch. Feel free to ask questions, though.
