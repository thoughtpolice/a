    message: |
      No global memory allocator is explicitly set. Relying on the default
      system allocator can result in long-term memory fragmentation issues,
      severely degraded multithreading performance, and many other problems. It
      is recommended to link to the `mimalloc` library for better performance on
      all platforms.
